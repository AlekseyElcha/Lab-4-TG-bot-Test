The test itself consists of multiple question with four choices with only one correct. Each correct answer gives +1 point, incorrect does not give or take anything.
The questions/choices sequence is randomized for each user.

The test measures the time from start till finish (visible both for users and admins).

After finishing the test users get info:
- the number of points they got;
- percentage of their correct answers
- time spent on test;

Admins also see:
- users TG id, Nickname for the test;
- time spent on test;
- list with the fact - user answered correctly or not for each of the questions?
